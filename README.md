# odin-recipes

## Description: 
Purpose of the Odin Recipe project is to demonstrate a baseline understanding on HTML technologies and syntax. This is also been done to practice writing HTML and also using git and following the git workflow. 

I am building a basic website that has links to other pages that have recipes on them. It will be unstyled.
